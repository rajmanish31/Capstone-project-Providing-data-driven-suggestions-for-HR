**3. Construct:** In the construction stage you will build models that will allow you access to hidden relationships locked within data.
Here are a few examples of the types of construction stage tasks:
* Select modeling approach

* Build machine learning algorithms

**4. Execute:** In the execution stage you will present the finding of your analysis, receive feedback, and make revisions as necessary.
